## Overview

My first challenge was to build a QR code component, getting it as close to the original design as possible.

### Built with

### Continued development

I think I have probably gone too in depth with this challenge and it could be refactored to make it simpler, so I will focus more on this in the future. This was my first time using figma designs so that will be something I continue to get to grips with.
